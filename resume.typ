== Projects

=== Big Data File Processing of IoT Data #sub[PySpark, Kafka, Zookeeper, MongoDB, Matplotlib]
- Designed and implemented a real-time streaming data pipeline using Kafka (3 producers) for IoT data ingestion, demonstrating ETL workflow building.
- Built PySpark processing layer for data transformation, enrichment, and anomaly detection using custom UDFs — directly applicable to big data tool operations.
- Modeled and implemented a MongoDB data warehouse schema with optimized upsert strategies for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Enabled event-driven visualization using MongoDB change streams and Matplotlib for real-time data monitoring.
- Delivered a scalable end-to-end pipeline for continuous ingestion, processing, and analysis of streaming data.


=== Patent Analyzer #sub[Python, Django, OpenAI, TogetherAI, QdrantDB, Selenium]
- Built an end-to-end data analysis platform using TRIZ principles and LLM reasoning to extract structured insights from raw patent documents.
- Designed and implemented a hybrid RAG pipeline (vector search + prompt engineering) using QdrantDB for semantic retrieval — demonstrating data wrangling and metric building.
- Developed automated data ingestion pipeline (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) for large-scale text extraction and preprocessing.
- Implemented Chain-of-Thought prompting strategies to improve classification accuracy and reasoning quality.

=== QR Invite — Event QR Invitation System #sub[Golang, PostgreSQL, pgx, sqlc, JWT, Docker]
- Built a backend system for managing event invitations via QR codes with participant management and attendance tracking.
- Designed PostgreSQL schema with sqlc code generation for type-safe, compile-time-checked database queries.
- Implemented JWT (HS256) authentication with bcrypt password hashing for admin endpoints.
- Integrated QR code generation (skip2/go-qrcode) and multi-channel invite delivery via WhatsApp (Meta Graph API) and email (Resend).
- Used Uber Zap for structured logging and pgx for high-performance PostgreSQL connectivity.

=== GitAegis — CLI Secret Scanner #sub[Golang, Cobra, Tree-sitter, Git]
- Implemented a CLI tool to detect secrets and API keys through entropy calculation methods.
- Integrated `tree-sitter` for optimized and accurate code structure analysis.
- Built configurable scanning via CLI flags and .toml configuration.
- Generated structured JSON outputs and automated .gitignore updates to prevent secret leaks.
